    "# EDA: Top 1000 Most Common Filipino Names\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this notebook where we will perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing the top 1000 most common Filipino names. The dataset provides valuable insights into the prevalence and characteristics of popular first names in the Philippines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this analysis is to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset and uncover meaningful patterns, trends, and distributions associated with the Filipino names. Through EDA, we will explore various aspects such as the gender distribution, popularity rankings, variations in names, name lengths, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "By conducting this analysis, we aim to shed light on the cultural significance of names in the Philippines, provide statistical summaries, and identify interesting observations that contribute to our knowledge of naming practices within the Filipino population.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset comprises six columns: rank, forename, incidence, frequency, gender and gender_percentage. Each row represents a unique name entry, with rank indicating the popularity rank of the name, gender denoting the gender associated with the name, forename representing the name itself, and incidence and frequency providing the respective measures of occurrence in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outline of Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this notebook, we will address a series of questions to gain insights into the dataset. We will perform data cleaning, visualize distributions, analyze gender ratios, examine popularity trends, explore name variations, investigate name lengths, and identify correlations between ranks, frequencies, and incidences.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following a structured approach and utilizing visualizations, statistical measures, and exploratory techniques, we aim to unravel the intriguing aspects of the dataset and draw meaningful conclusions about the most common Filipino names.\n",
